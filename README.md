## Technologies




Project is created with:


-  HTML

-  SCSS/SASS

-  JavaScript



## Features




-  Create a list of tasks by entering a task into the ‘add a task’ box

-  Check off tasks as you complete them

-  Delete the tasks as you wish by pressing the 'x' button

-  Oceanic background for tranquility and beauty because that’s how organizing your life should be!




## Challenges




-  Opacity of task boxes (make box opaque without making the inner content opaque)

-  Getting the delete button to work 
 
-  Getting the checkbox to work properly (if there was more than one task, I could check off the tasks. But when I would check off one of the tasks, all of the tasks would be crossed out instead of only the one I pressed).



## Inspiration

I usually have an idea of the tasks I want to complete but I tend to just leave them in my head. I wanted to make something that would help me declutter my mind and increase my productivity. I wanted the task list to have a good appearance since that would make me want to use it more. The design was inspired by the Microsoft To Do app's daily planner.
